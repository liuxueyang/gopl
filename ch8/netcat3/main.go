// This program is a simple TCP client, similar to a basic version of netcat. Hereâ€™s what it does:

// Connects to a TCP server at localhost:8080.
// Starts a goroutine to copy data from the server (conn) to the standard output (os.Stdout).
// When the server closes the connection, it logs a message and signals the main goroutine via a channel.
// In the main goroutine, it copies data from standard input (os.Stdin) to the server (conn) using the mustCopy function.
// Closes the connection after input is done, then waits for the background goroutine to finish.
// Summary:
// It lets you type input and send it to the server, while also displaying any data received from the server.
// It handles both directions concurrently and exits cleanly when either side closes the connection.

	conn, err := net.Dial("tcp", "localhost:8080")

		log.Fatal(err)

	go func() {
		// Closing the read half causes the background goroutine's call to
		// io.Copy to return a "read from closed connection" error.
		// mustCopy(os.Stdout, conn)

		io.Copy(os.Stdout, conn)
		log.Println("Connection closed by server")
		done <- struct{}{}
	}()
